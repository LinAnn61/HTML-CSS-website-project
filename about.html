    <p>KodeChunx is a website resource designed with the absolute novice to coding skills in mind. Changes
    in the UK labour market in 2023 and some years previously, have seen a rise in opportunities in the
    digital sector. Also, the State Retirement Age has increased and more senior people will be expected
    to work for longer, before being eligible for their pension. Some Jobseekers of all ages may be
    seeking career changes from first principles for myriad reasons and granular introductions to new
    employment opportunities are of pivotal importance.</p>

    It may be the case, that someone is interested in a career in the digital sector, but is not familiar with
    any of the “tech speak”, or computer usage other than emails and online shopping. In some cases,
    prior digital knowledge may be zero. Simple introductory level glossaries are needed, progressing to
    the fundamentals of coding, before established accredited courses of Level 1 or above can be
    undertaken. The journey to a new digital career from absolute scratch has to start somewhere.   
    That start is KodeChunx.</p>
